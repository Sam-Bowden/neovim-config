# neovim-config
My personal configuration for Neovim written in pure Lua as opposed to Vimscript.

I have designed this configuration for my own use case - it doesn't aim to be a good configuration for other people. I have uploaded this to GitHub so I can easily share/update this between my computers and because it might help others that are writing their own Neovim configurations in Lua.
