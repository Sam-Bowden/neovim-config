# neovim-config
My personal configuration for Neovim written in pure Lua.

I have written this for my own personal constraints - it doesn't aim to work for other people. I have uploaded this to GitHub so I can easily share and update this between my computers. However, the code I have written in my configuration may provide use to other people that are developing their own Neovim configurations in Lua.
